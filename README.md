# About me
I am a junior manual tester. I have skills in bug reporting, writing test cases, and API testing. In my previous job, I gained experience in effectively communicating within a team, coordinating tasks, and creating work reports. 
I am actively seeking an opportunity to gain practical experience on a real-life IT project.
